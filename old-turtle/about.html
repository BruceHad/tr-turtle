    <h2>Turtles</h2>
    <p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>, which was a toy car that could be programmed with a route (3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on) and would then follow that route (until it crashed into the skirting boards).</p>
    <p>To program something similar (aka a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>) you just needs to know a couple of actions: move and turn, while keeping track of current location and direction. With that you have a basic turtle.</p>
    <pre><code>function Turtle(){
  var location = [0,0]; // Set starting location
  var angle = 0; // Angle is in radians
  var canvas = new Canvas(); // Need a canvas to draw on
  this.rotate = function(anglePercent) {
    angle += anglePercent * Math.PI *2;
  };
  this.forward = function(dist) {
    newLocation = [location[0]+ Math.cos(angle) * dist,
            location[1]+ Math.sin(angle) * dist];
    canvas.draw(location, newLocation, pen);
    location = [newLocation[0], newLocation[1]];
  };
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Add in a few basic controls and and canvas to draw on and you've got the beginnings of your own turtle to play with.</p>
    <div class="canvas-wrapper" id="one">
      <canvas id="canvasone" width="450" height="300">
        <p>Canvas cannot be displayed.</p>
      </canvas>
      <div class="form-wrapper">
        <div class="buttons turtle-controls">
          <button name="t-left">Left</button>
          <button name="t-forward">Forward</button>
          <button name="t-right">Right</button><br>
					<button name="t-clear">Clear Drawing</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>But that's just the beginning. The cool thing about the Big Trak was the ability to program in a course and let it go off on it's own.</p>
    <p>One way of doing this is to set up a string of commands, each command mapping to an action e.g. F mean move forward. Then when we hit GO, the turtle reads each command in turn and follows the course set for it.</p>
    <div class="canvas-wrapper" id="two">
      <canvas id="canvastwo" width="450" height="300">
        <p>Canvas cannot be displayed.</p>
      </canvas>
      <div class="form-wrapper">
        <div class="buttons turtle-controls">
          <label for="tt-string">Command Window:</label><br>
          <textarea id="tt-string" name="tt-string" value=""></textarea><br>
          <button name="queue-left">Queue Left</button>
          <button name="queue-forward">Queue Forward</button>
          <button name="queue-right">Queue Right</button><br>
					<button name="queue-clear">Clear Drawing</button>
          <button name="queue-go">Go Draw It</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The nice thing about this way of controlling the turtle is that we can easily write a program that will generate those strings of letters mathematically. For example, try copying the following string into the 'Command Window' and hitting Go.</p>
    <pre><code>RFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRRLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRRLRFRLLFLRLLRFRRLFLRLLRFRLLFLR
</code></pre>

    <p>Try programming that manually!</p>

    <p>That string of commands I generated was based on a pattern called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">Dragon Curve</a>. It's one of many patterns that can be generated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmayer System</a>.</p>
    <p>L-Systems consist of alphabets of commands (like 'F' is the command for forward()). It starts with a basic string (the axiom) and a set of rules. These rules are repeatedly applied to the string to generate more and more complicated set of commands.</p>
    <p>For a dragon curve you start with the axiom 'FX' then apply the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace F with null</li>
      <li>Replace X with X+YF+</li>
      <li>Replace Y with −FX−Y</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the first few iterations look something like this:</p>
    <p>0: FX <br>1: X+YF+ <br>2: X+YF++−FX−Y+ <br>3: X+YF++−FX−Y++−X+YF+−−FX−Y+</p>
    <p>Where F stands for 'move forward', + stands for 'turn right' and - 'turn left'. (X and Y are used in the L-system but don't equate to any actions).</p>
		<p>L-systems were actually developed by a biologist (in 1968) called Arstid Lindenmayer. It's therefore quite good at modelling plant growth. They can also be used to describe fractal-like forms.</p>
